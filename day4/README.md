# Return Window Tracker

Return Window Tracker is a tiny web app for tracking purchase return deadlines and exporting calendar reminders.

## Why this exists

Most return windows are buried in receipts or account pages. A quick local tracker helps you avoid missing short deadlines.

## Features

- Track multiple purchases with purchase date + return window
- Highlights items due soon or overdue
- Export all deadlines to a single `.ics` calendar file
- Copyable summary for notes or chats
- Local-only, no accounts or tracking

## Run

Open `index.html` in a browser.
