# TrialGuard

TrialGuard is a tiny web app that generates a calendar reminder to cancel free trials before they renew.

## Why this exists

Most free trial tools are either buried inside subscription managers or locked behind accounts. A fast, local-only reminder builder is a practical gap.

## Features

- Calculates trial end, cancel-by, and reminder time
- Exports a one-click `.ics` calendar file
- Copyable summary for chat or notes
- Local-only, no accounts or tracking

## Run

Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Other underserviced micro-app ideas

- Return window tracker: order date + return window, output final return date
- Refill timer: fill date + supply days, output reorder reminder
